Some object *SPLocale* should be defined (or maybe some existing may be used), which should hold information (list may be filled up):
  * language ISO code (for using with )
  * months names
  * currency name (ISO code, prefix, postfix)
  * applicable decimal points symbols, and prefferable one

I think, some *SPTranslation* object should be defined, with translation of strings like "Save", "Exit", "Generate" and so on. It should hold language ISO code aswell. It should be separated from *SPLocale* to have a possibility to make several translation versions for one language (for example, it may be "Generate" or "Generate report" or "Submit").

SPSession should hold one instance of *SPLocale* and one instance of *SPTranslation*. And every component should/may ask sesion for necessary locale info.
